# Fintech Application Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture of a Fintech application designed to handle user registration, document validation, loan requests, and payment processing. Below, you'll find the detailed explanation of each system component and the technologies selected for implementation.

## High-Level Architecture

The image below represents the overall architecture of the application:

---

## Frontend: Mobile Application

The mobile application serves as the entry point for users, enabling registration, loan requests, and payments. It communicates with backend services securely through the following layers.

### Selected Technologies:
- **React Native** or **Flutter**: Cross-platform frameworks for efficient mobile development.
- **Swift** (iOS) or **Kotlin/Java** (Android): For native mobile development when performance is a priority.

In this case I choose **React Native** due to its flexibility for both iOS and Android, as well as the availability of developers and learning resources.

---

## Infrastructure Overview

### **Cloudflare**
- Protects against DDoS attacks and caches static resources to improve response times.
- Distributes traffic efficiently to backend services.

### **API Gateway (KrakenD)**
- Routes and manages API requests, enforcing security policies and handling authentication.

### **Kubernetes (EKS)**
- Manages containerized services in pods with automated scaling using **Carpenter** to adjust resources dynamically based on demand.

---

## Backend Services

### **BFF (Backend for Frontend)**
- Acts as a dedicated layer to handle communication between the mobile app and backend services.
- Manages user authentication and session control.

### **RESTful APIs**
- Built using **Python with FastAPI** for its simplicity, performance, and ease of collaboration with a large developer base.

### **Kafka-Based Data Pipeline**
1. **Incoming Topic:** Receives raw data for processing.
2. **Redis Cache:** Filters duplicates and reduces database load by storing frequently accessed data.
3. **Validation Service:** Validates incoming data, sending results to the **Validation Topic**.
4. **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):** Stores failed data for manual or automated reprocessing.
5. **Trusted Layer:** Validated data is enriched and forwarded to downstream systems.

#### **Processing Technologies:**
- **Benthos.io** or **Redpanda**: Frameworks for advanced Kafka message processing, with pipelines implemented in **Python**.

## External Integrations

The system integrates with external APIs for document validation, tax authority checks, and digital signature services:

- **eSignature Services**: For secure document signing.
- **Federal Revenue Office**: For tax document validation.
- **ECM Services**: For electronic content management.

---

## Data Storage

The application uses a relational database for transactional data:

- **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Provides high availability and automatic failover, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

---

## Monitoring and Logging

The system ensures reliability through comprehensive monitoring and logging:

### **Selected Tools:**
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Centralized logging for debugging and auditing.
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: Real-time monitoring and customizable dashboards to track performance and detect issues.

---

## Infrastructure as Code

The entire infrastructure is managed with **Terraform**, enabling consistent deployment and simplified scaling.

---

## Scalability and Resilience

- **Auto-scaling Pods with Kubernetes**: Ensures efficient resource usage with **Carpenter** for cost optimization.
- **Redis Cache**: Improves system responsiveness by caching frequently accessed data.
- **Load Balancer (AWS ALB)**: Distributes traffic across backend services for fault tolerance.
